_Two important points about your Work With Me document:_

1. It's your document—this is just a starting point to help you in beginning to write it. Feel free to add and
remove sections. Feel free to start with an empty page and fill it out however you'd like.
1. It's meant to be a change with you—update it as frequently (or infrequently) as you'd like.

_You might want to [estimate the reading time](http://niram.org/read/) of your document and keep it to 5 minutes or less._

## Values

I value honesty, humor, learning, knowledge, and wisdom.  I find satisfaction in solving problems, especially when other people feel they have benefitted from it.

## Personality

How do you act in the world? This can be a combination of descriptive and aspirational traits.

- Candid
- Curious
- Introspective
- Articulate
- Droll / Jocular / Satirical

I strive to admit my mistakes and be transparent when something has gone wrong.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

- Positive: I certainly appreciate recognition of my positive contributions, but also feel self-conscious/shy being the center of attention.
- Negative: I strive to be open to constructive criticism and avoid defensiveness.  It helps if I'm warned to brace for constructive criticism and this aspiration is invoked.

## Work Patterns

My energy and focus are better in the afternoon than the morning.  I start concentrating on work around 10am EST but am often responsive to messages before that, and I can be very flexible to accommodate other people's schedules.

I think I'm equally comfortable working alone or pairing up.  In larger group I start to become more reserved.

## Communication Preferences

Slack is the best way to get my attention quickly.  Phone/video calls are definitely best for topics that require interactive discussion, but I prefer to keep my phone completely silent so a Slack/text message to bring my attention to an incoming call is very helpful.

Messages outside work hours are welcome with the caveat that I may or may not respond quickly.

<!-- ## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?
What about when you're just not having an "on" or "good" day?

### How to help

This might also be a good place
to present recommendations for how we can be supportive towards you when you've gone to the
Dark Side.

## Me Being Me

Any habits that of yours that can be easily misinterpreted? Here's a good place to point them out.-->

## Pet Peeves

I get frustrated by the assertion that two spaces after a period is wrong.

<!-- ## Career Goals & Future Interests

What long term career goals do you have for yourself? What interests do you hope or plan for your
future self to obsess over. --> -->

## Areas for Development

### Tangents

**Tangents:** I'm sometimes overly-prone to tangents in both conversation and tasks.  How welcome or unwelcome this is varies by circumstance and between people.  I have been advised to "beware of rabbit holes" by a past manager.  I try to keep myself in check, but forgiveness and a gentle reminder to stay focused are helpful when it's becoming unappreciated.

**"Realism":** I can be pessimistic at times, although I see it as being realistic rather than fanciful.  Let me know if it's affecting other people's moods so I can try to do better.
